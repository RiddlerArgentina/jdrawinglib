# Command: string2 x y a str
# Arguments:
#    'x'   (int) x coordinate from the lower left corner
#    'y'   (int) y coordinate from the lower left corner
#    'a'   (int) angle of the string in degrees
#    'str' (String) The string to print on the canvas
# Description: Writes an inclined string on the canvas
# Notes: The string can't have more than one space between words
#        (they will be removed), other invalid characters are an
#        odd number of double quotes ", and note that everything
#        to the right of a numeral # will be omitted
#        The font and color of strings can be changed, but that's
#        in other examples (color, font).
#        You can also rotate strings with the 'rotate' keyword
#        but this is not recommended
#        Strings automatically compensate the 'invert_y' flag, so
#        it's possible to experience unexpected behavior when
#        using 'scale' with negative Y arguments.
#        Strings can have special characters as seen in the
#        'music sheet' example, but of course this will fail
#        misserably on winbugs so it's not recommended
# Use example:
bounds 210 210 center invert_y
stroke 0.3;color 200 200 200;grid 200 200 10 10
color 0 0 0; stroke 1
# Example starts
string2 -100  100  45 45Â° degree
string2 -100 -100 -10 this String has "quotes"!
# This is a small example of creating a string using fors
for1 0 90 350 "string2 20 20 %1$d Hello World!"
# There's no real need to align the numbers...
