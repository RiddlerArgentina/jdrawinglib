# Command: vectc x1 y1 x2 y2
# Description: creates a vector segment based on two points
#              the tip of the vector will be pointing to the
#              second point
# Use example:
# Don't pay much attention to this lines, I just put a
# grid on the background to make the example clear.
# Set the bounds, center the origin and invert the Y axis
bounds 210 210 center invert_y
