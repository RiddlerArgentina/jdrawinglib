# Command: string x y str
# Arguments:
#    'x'   (int) x coordinate from the lower left corner
#    'y'   (int) y coordinate from the lower left corner
#    'str' (String) The string to print on the canvas
# Description: Writes a string on the canvas
# Notes: The string can't have more than one space between words
#        (they will be removed), other invalid characters are an
#        odd number of double quotes ", and note that everything
#        to the right of a numeral # will be omitted
#        The font, color and angle of strings can be changed, but
#        that's in other examples (string2, color, font, rotate)
#        Strings automatically compensate the 'invert_y' flag, so
#        it's possible to experience unexpected behavior when
#        using 'scale' with negative Y arguments.
# Use example:
bounds 210 210 center invert_y
stroke 0.3;color 200 200 200;grid 200 200 10 10
color 0 0 0; stroke 1
# Example starts
string 0 0 hello world
string -100 -100 this String has "quotes"!
# This is a small example of creating a string using fors
for2 -80 10 100 0 1 9 "string %1$d 70 %2$d"
# There's no real need to align the numbers...
