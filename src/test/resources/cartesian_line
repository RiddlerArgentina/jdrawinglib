# Command: linec x1 y1 x2 y2
# Arguments:
#    'x1' (int) x coordinate of the start point
#    'y1' (int) y coordinate of the start point
#    'x2' (int) x coordinate of the end point
#    'y2' (int) y coordinate of the end point
# Description: creates a line segment based on two points
# Notes: If the 'invert_y' flag is used the angle will be counted
#        counter clockwise (and viceversa).
#        If the length is a negative number it will be equivalent to
#        adding 180Â° to the angle
# Use example:
# Don't pay much attention to this three lines, I just put a
# grid on the background to make the example clear.
# Set the canvas size, center the origin and invert the Y axis
