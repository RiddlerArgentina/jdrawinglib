# Command: vectp x y l a
# Arguments: 
#    'x' (int)   x coordinate of the origin
#    'y' (int)   y coordinate of the origin
#    'l' (float) length of the vector
#    'a' (float) angle in degrees
# Description: creates a vector segment based on one point, a length
#              and an angle. The tip of the arrow will be pointing
#              away from the point of origin
# Notes: If the 'invert_y' flag is used the angle will be counted
#        counter clockwise (and viceversa).
#        If the length is a negative number it will be equivalent to
#        adding 180Â° to the angle
# Use example:
# Don't pay much attention to this three lines, I just put a 
# grid on the background to make the example clear.
# Set the canvas size, center the origin and invert the Y axis
