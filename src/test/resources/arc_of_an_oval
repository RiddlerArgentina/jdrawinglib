# Command: arc x y w h a o
# Arguments:
#    'x' (int) x coordinate of the center
#    'y' (int) y coordinate of the center
#    'w' (int) width of the rectangle
#    'h' (int) height of the rectange
#    'a' (int) angle in degrees of the arc
#    'o' (int) angle offset in degrees
# Description: Creates an arc of an oval
# Note: If the 'invert_y' the offset angle is counted clockwise.
#       The dotted lines in the example are placed there just to
#       illustrate the oval from which the arc was created
# Use example:
