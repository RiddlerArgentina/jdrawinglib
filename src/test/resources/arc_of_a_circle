# Command: arcc x y r a o
# Arguments:
#    'x' (int) x coordinate of the origin
#    'y' (int) y coordinate of the origin
#    'r' (int) radius of the circle
#    'a' (int) angle in degrees of the arc
#    'o' (int) angle offset in degrees
# Description: Creates an arc of a circle
# Note: If the 'invert_y' the offset angle is counted clockwise.
#       The dotted lines in the example are placed there just to
#       illustrate the real circle from which the arc was created
# Use example:
